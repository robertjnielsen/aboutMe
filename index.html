        <h2>A Little About Me</h2>
        <p>
            I am a self-taught web developer who is attending Code Fellows to obtain a formal education in coding and
            development. I am a father, and a husband. I love food and the outdoors, which means in the summer months
            you can find me grilling, hiking, or camping! Also, I <i>hate</i> the cold.
        </p>
        <h2>My Goal</h2>
        <p>
            My goal as a developer is to help organizations make the web more intuitive and accessible for all users!
        </p>

                    I have experience in a variety of labor fields, from warehouse work to construction and the saw mill
                    industry. I spent a number of years as a short-order cook, and even spent some time in the military.
