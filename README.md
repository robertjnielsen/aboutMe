Code Fellows 201 Lab: About Me

This About Me page lists a small bit of information about me both personally and professionally.

It also includes a simple guessing game completed through JavaScript prompts and alerts. The game asks 5 questions about me, 1 random number guessing question, and 1 question where the user must attempt to guess one of my favorite colors.

The guessing game will keep track of a user's score (correct answers) and inform them at the end how they've done.

This About Me page is an ongoing lab assignment for Code Fellows' 201 class.
