## Overview
Code Fellows 201 Lab: About Me

About Me is a lab assignment from the Code Fellows 201 course.  

This About Me page lists a small bit of information about me both personally and professionally.

It also includes a simple guessing game completed through JavaScript prompts and alerts. The game asks 5 questions about me, 1 random number guessing question, and 1 question where the user must attempt to guess one of my favorite colors.

The guessing game will keep track of a user's score (correct answers) and inform them at the end how they've done.
